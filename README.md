# 🕒 Time Series Sales Forecasting (Internship Task)

This project is part of an internship at **Internship Intelligence**, aimed at building a time series forecasting model to predict future sales using historical data.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of the following files:

- `train.csv` — Historical sales data
- `test.csv` — Test data for prediction
- `store.csv` — Metadata about stores

---

## 🧠 Objective

- Analyze historical sales data.
- Use ARIMA or Prophet model to forecast future sales.
- Evaluate model using MAE and RMSE.
- Visualize predictions and actuals.
- (Optional) Deploy the solution using Streamlit.

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Prophet
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Streamlit (optional)

---

## 🔎 Evaluation Metrics

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures average magnitude of errors.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Measures square root of average squared errors.
